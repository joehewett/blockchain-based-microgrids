## Ethereum Network Configurations

This directory includes all the required configurations to set up an Ethereum network:

* ___Genesis file___: Network configuration for Ethereum nodes. Sets properties such as consensus algorithm, account pre-funding, and genesis block configurations
* ___Private keys___: The private key for every account in the network is stored here. Ordinarily, each user would have a copy
* ___Dockerfiles___: Docker files for Ethereum nodes, both proof of work and proof of authority
